# Checking-pallindrome-number-in-simplest-and-shortest-code
Using the reverse slicing I have written a code in the simplest and shortest way to check whether a number is pallindrome or not.
You can also apply this on strings by simply removing int type from n in this code.
The codes are totally written in python.
